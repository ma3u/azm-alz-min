# Building a Secure Azure Landing Zone with Infrastructure as Code: A Complete DevOps Journey

*How I implemented a production-ready Azure Key Vault deployment using Bicep, GitHub, and Azure DevOps with full CI/CD automation*

## 🚀 The Challenge

As organizations accelerate their cloud adoption, the need for secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure deployment becomes critical. Traditional manual deployment processes are error-prone, inconsistent, and don't scale. This is where Azure Landing Zones come in—providing a proven architectural foundation for secure cloud workloads.

In this article, I'll walk you through my complete implementation of a minimal Azure Landing Zone focused on secure Key Vault deployment, using modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices with Bicep templates and automated CI/CD pipelines.

## 🏗️ What We're Building

Our solution includes:

- **🔐 Secure Azure Key Vault**: Premium tier with RBAC, soft delete, and purge protection
- **📜 Bicep Infrastructure as Code**: Modern, type-safe ARM template alternative
- **🔄 Dual Repository Strategy**: Public GitHub repo for collaboration, private Azure DevOps for enterprise CI/CD
- **🚀 Automated CI/CD**: Full deployment pipeline with security scanning and approval gates
- **🛡️ Security Best Practices**: Following Azure Well-Architected Framework principles

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Infrastructure as Code with Bicep

Instead of using traditional ARM JSON templates, I chose Bicep for its simplicity and type safety:

```bicep
// Generate unique, compliant Key Vault name
var uniqueName = '${namePrefix}-${take(uniqueString(resourceGroup().id), 15)}'

module keyVault 'br/public:avm/res/key-vault/vault:0.4.0' = {
  name: 'keyVaultDeployment'
  params: {
    name: uniqueName
    location: location
    enableRbacAuthorization: true
    networkAcls: {
      bypass: 'AzureServices'
      defaultAction: 'Allow'
    }
    tags: {
      Environment: 'Production'
      Purpose: 'Landing Zone'
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Bicep over ARM JSON?**
- 🎯 **Simplified Syntax**: 50% less code than equivalent ARM JSON
- 🔍 **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents common errors
- 🔄 **Module Reusability**: Leveraging Azure Verified Modules (AVM)
- 🛠️ **Better Developer Experience**: IntelliSense and validation in VS Code

### 2. Dual Repository Strategy

**Challenge**: How do you balance open-source collaboration with enterprise security?

**Solution**: Implement a dual repository approach:

#### Public GitHub Repository Benefits:
- 🌐 **Community Visibility**: Showcases best practices to the community
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Others can contribute improvements and use as reference
- 📚 **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- ⭐ **Professional Portfolio**: Demonstrates technical expertise

#### Private Azure DevOps Repository Benefits:
- 🔐 **Security**: Real subscription IDs and sensitive configurations
- 🏢 **Enterprise Integration**: Full Azure DevOps ecosystem
- 🛡️ **Compliance**: Advanced security scanning and approval workflows
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Detailed deployment analytics and reporting

### 3. Automated Synchronization

The key to making this work is seamless synchronization between repositories:

```yaml
# GitHub Action for automatic sync to Azure DevOps
name: Sync to Azure DevOps

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Push to Azure DevOps
        run: |
          git remote add azuredevops https://${{ secrets.AZDO_USERNAME }}:${{ secrets.AZDO_PAT }}@dev.azure.com/matthiasbuchhorn/avm-alz-min/_git/repo
          git push azuredevops main --force
```

### 4. Production-Ready CI/CD Pipeline

The Azure DevOps pipeline implements enterprise-grade practices:

#### Continuous Integration Features:
- ✅ **Bicep Linting**: Validates template syntax and best practices
- 🔍 **Security Scanning**: PSRule for Azure compliance checking
- 🏗️ **Template Building**: Compiles Bicep to ARM for deployment
- 📦 **Artifact Management**: Secure storage and versioning

#### Continuous Deployment Features:
- 🔄 **What-If Analysis**: Preview changes before deployment
- 🎯 **Environment Promotion**: Dev → Prod with approval gates
- ✅ **Post-Deployment Validation**: Automated testing and health checks
- 📊 **Deployment Monitoring**: Real-time status and notifications

```yaml
# Pipeline template for reusable deployments
parameters:
  - name: environmentName
    type: string
    values: [dev, prod]

steps:
  - task: AzureCLI@2
    displayName: 'Deploy with What-If Analysis'
    inputs:
      azureSubscription: '$(azureServiceConnection)'
      scriptType: 'bash'
      scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
      inlineScript: |
        # Preview changes
        az deployment group what-if \
          --resource-group "rg-avm-alz-${{ parameters.environmentName }}" \
          --template-file "infra/main.bicep" \
          --parameters namePrefix="kv-${{ parameters.environmentName }}"
        
        # Deploy if approved
        az deployment group create \
          --resource-group "rg-avm-alz-${{ parameters.environmentName }}" \
          --template-file "infra/main.bicep" \
          --parameters namePrefix="kv-${{ parameters.environmentName }}" \
          --name "deployment-$(Build.BuildId)"
```
